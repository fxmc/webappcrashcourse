REACT := JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI)
    a. Driven by components
    b. Declarative
    c. Driven by State

Component: a piece of the interface, containing both content (html) and functionality (js).  Combine many  components into an applicationg

Declarative: tell React how the UI looks like, but not how to go about creating it [using JSX] -> Never manipulate DOM

State: Any data that the UI / Component is based on.  When we update state variable in component, React will automatically update DOM

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd today-i-learned
  npm start

Happy hacking!
